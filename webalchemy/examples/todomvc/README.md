##Obligatory [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) implementation
The implementation consists of a minimally modified template (just added a few ids to some elements in the main html) and a single Python source file [todomvc.py](todomvc.py). The app can be served through a websocket or run completely statically served - checkout the result on github pages [here](http://skariel.org/webalchemy/todomvc.html)

The app is very compliant with the spec, I could not find any difference i nfunctionality or behaviour when compared to AngularJS or VanillaJS implementations. The source is a bit longer than what's needed with Angular but hey, nothing stops you from using weba+Angular for the perfect realtime app. And yes, the next step is making this todo app collaborative. Should not be too hard with weba.
