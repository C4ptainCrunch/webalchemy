{"name":"webalchemy","tagline":"realtime, Pythonic webframework","body":"### What's this all about\r\nGo check out the [meteor platform](http://www.meteor.com/). The demos are really impressive. Then come back to this and think, \"...ported to Python\" (kudos nuclearqtip for the pitch!) See out initial [presentaion](https://vimeo.com/73073766), soon to be improved. Note the project is very new, documentation is still missing, but on a high priority\r\n\r\n### 1. Fast and scalable\r\nBuilt on top of the asynchronous networking library [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/), which has [similar performance](http://jaranto.blogspot.co.il/2013/06/javascript-nodejs-vs-python-tornado.html) to [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)\r\n\r\n### 2. Minimalist\r\nCouple webalchemy with what you want.. say [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) or the [web2py](http://www.web2py.com/) database layer. It's not full-stack but it fully addresses the issue of realtime without having to use complex Javascript when the cleaner, nicer language is Python  -that's subjective! (kudos metaperl for the pitch)\r\n\r\n### 3. Open source\r\nLicensed under the MIT License","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
